The goal of this project, is to put wind turbines on top of plants/greenhouses, and use the generated energy to heat the plants during winter.

If things go crazy enough, it might be possible to power an uC or a smartphone inside the greenhouse to monitor the plant (check humidity, temperature, sun exposition, take photos, ...)

First stage is to 3d print a wind turbine.
